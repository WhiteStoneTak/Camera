                      <p>In this year, I arrived to Canada to study. The diversity among people had me notice the attractiveness of Canada. Since my hobby is to ski, I had skied many times last winter.</p>

What surprised me the most is that, I could keep a conversation with my cousin in English. My goal for the future is to improve more intellectually, and work with people from other countries.</p>
